          Happy Birthday Mom! I love you to the sky and back infinite amount of times. I'm so lucky to have you as a mom. Your always caring for us, putting yourself before us and making sure were happy. You've given us so much in our life, I'm so grateful. Thinking back on all of fun trips we had I'm so glad you made it possible to have those family memories. I miss you so much, I have my canvas picture of you to remind me of you. Have a amazing birthday week!
